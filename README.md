# Credit Card Directive: A Coding Challenge in AngularJS
## By Jason Schapiro

**See the live version on http://creditcard.jasonschapiro.com**

FEATURES
===========
* Validates a card number via the Luhn-10 Algorithm
* Changes the card logo inside of the input depending on what type of card is being entered.
* If the card is invalid, the card box becomes red. When valid, turns green
* External Attributes that can let you know the current card number and validation status

INSTALLATION
===========
Clone the repo, then run `npm install`, `bower install` and `grunt serve` to run the application locally.

You can run the tests using the `grunt test` command.

**This was just a coding challenge, but if you think this would be a helpful directive for you, let me know and I'll publish it to bower!**
